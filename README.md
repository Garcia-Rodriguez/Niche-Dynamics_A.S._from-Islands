# Niche-Dynamics_A.S._from-Islands
Data and codes for the analyses implemented in "Patterns and drivers of climatic niche dynamics during biological invasions of island-endemic tetrapods" by Garcia-Rodriguez et al.

Here we provide the final datasets and codes supporting the findings of this study. The files include:
  1. The clean occurrences used to estimate NMIs as well as metrics derived from the COUE approach 
  2. The full dataset for the 118 clusters analyzed. This file contains both the metrics describing niche dynamics and 
  the values for all 9 predictors tested in the Linear Mixed Models
  3. The code used for the COUE scheme
  4. The code used to estimate NMIs
  5. The code for the GLMMs
